Found 3 Required Inputs
--------------------------------
A required input is one that is designated as required
for all failing patterns for one or more cpoints and fans out 
to more failing than passing points.
This implies that it may be driving downstream logic that is related to
the failure(s)
--------------------------------
i:/WORK/comparator_ds/SEL[0]
    Fans out to 1 failing and 0 passing points and has
    logic value '0' for 1 compare point(s):
        i:/WORK/comparator_ds/OUT

-----------
i:/WORK/comparator_ds/SEL[1]
    Fans out to 1 failing and 0 passing points and has
    logic value '1' for 1 compare point(s):
        i:/WORK/comparator_ds/OUT

-----------
i:/WORK/comparator_ds/SEL[2]
    Fans out to 1 failing and 0 passing points and has
    logic value '1' for 1 compare point(s):
        i:/WORK/comparator_ds/OUT
