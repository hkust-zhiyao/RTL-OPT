Found 4 X Sources
--------------------------------
X sources are objects in the implementation design that are the source
of unknown logic values that propagate to failing compare points. The
most common types are undriven nets, tristates and power-off X corruption cells.

i:/WORK/sub_4bit_mini/diff[0]
    Propagates 'X' to the impl compare point in the cones for 1 compare point(s):
