Found 8 Unmatched Cone Inputs
--------------------------------
Unmatched cone inputs result either from mismatched compare points
or from differences in the logic within the cones. Only unmatched
inputs that are suspected of contributing to verification failures
are included in the report.
The source of the matching or logical differences may be determined
using the schematic, cone and source views.

Found 2 Required Inputs
--------------------------------
A required input is one that is designated as required
for all failing patterns for one or more cpoints and fans out 
to more failing than passing points.
This implies that it may be driving downstream logic that is related to
the failure(s)
--------------------------------
i:/WORK/sub_8bit_mini/a[2]
    Fans out to 7 failing and 0 passing points and has
    logic value '0' for 1 compare point(s):
        i:/WORK/sub_8bit_mini/diff[2]

-----------
i:/WORK/sub_8bit_mini/b[2]
    Fans out to 6 failing and 0 passing points and has
    logic value '0' for 1 compare point(s):
        i:/WORK/sub_8bit_mini/diff[3]
